# Work-Day-Scheduler

This project was created in order to make a simple daily calender in order to log activities needed to be done within business hours. This was done by usuing the provided HTML skeleton and CSS file to use as a guide in what the functionality of the JS file would look like. The tasks are able to now be saved to the  user's local storage and are also color cordinated to indicate whether or not the task has already passed the present moment in time.
